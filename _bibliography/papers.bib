  abstract={In birds and feathered non-avian dinosaurs, within-feather pigmentation
  patterns range from discrete spots and stripes to more subtle patterns, but the
  latter remain largely unstudied. A ~55 million year old fossil contour feather with
  a dark distal tip grading into a lighter base was recovered from the Fur Formation
  in Denmark. SEM and synchrotron-based trace metal mapping confirmed that this
  gradient was caused by differential concentration of melanin. To assess the
  potential ecological and phylogenetic prevalence of this pattern, we evaluated 321
  modern samples from 18 orders within Aves. We observed that the pattern was found
  most frequently in distantly related groups that share aquatic ecologies (e.g.
  waterfowl Anseriformes, penguins Sphenisciformes), suggesting a potential adaptive
  function with ancient origins.}

  of nondestructive high‐resolution X‐ray computed tomographic (CT) scanning, provides
  a window into their acoustic abilities and ecological preferences. Inner ear labyrinths
  also may be a source for additional morphological characters for phylogenetic analyses.
  In this study, we explore digital endocasts of the inner ear labyrinths of representative
  species of extinct and extant porpoises (Mammalia: Cetacea: Phocoenidae), a clade of some
  of the smallest odontocete cetaceans, which produce some of the highest‐frequency clicks
  for biosonar and communication. Metrics used to infer hearing ranges based on cochlear
  morphology indicate that all taxa considered could hear high‐frequency sounds, thus the
  group had already acquired high‐frequency hearing capabilities by the Miocene (9–11 Mya)
  at the latest. Vestibular morphology indicates that extant species with pelagic
  preferences have similarly low semicircular canal deviations from 90°, values indicating
  more sensitivity to head rotations. Species with near‐shore preferences have higher canal
  deviation values, indicating less sensitivity to head rotations. Extending these analyses
  to the extinct species, we demonstrate a good match between those predicted to have
  coastal (such as Semirostrum cerutti) preferences and high canal deviation values. We
  establish new body length relationships based on correlations with inner ear labyrinth
  volume, which can be further explored among other aquatic mammals to infer body size
  of specimens consisting of fragmentary material.}

  abstract={Four extant lineages of mammals have invaded and diversified in the water: Sirenia, Cetacea, Pinnipedia, and Lutrinae.
    Most of these aquatic clades are larger bodied, on average, than their closest land-dwelling relatives, but the extent to which potential
    ecological, biomechanical, and physiological controls contributed to this pattern remains untested quantitatively. Here, we use previously
    published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in
    aquatic mammals through both comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record. Both methods indicate that the
    evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The
    existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most
    hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with
    control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms.
    Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum
    size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather
    than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic
    demands of the aquatic medium.},

  abstract={At least 26 species of crocodylian populate the globe today, but this richness represents a minute fraction of the diversity and
    disparity of Crocodyliformes. Fossil forms are far more varied, spanning from erect, fully terrestrial species to flippered, fully
    marine species. To quantify the influence of a marine habitat on the directionality, rate, and variance of evolution of body size
    in Crocodyliformes and thereby identify underlying selective pressures, we compiled a database of body sizes for 264 fossil and
    modern species of crocodyliform covering terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and marine habitats.We find increases in body size coupled with
    increases in strength of selection and decreases in variance following invasions of marine habitats but not of semiaquatic habitats.
    A model combining constraints from thermoregulation and lung capacity provides a physiological explanation for the larger
    minimum and average sizes of marine species. It appears that constraints on maximum size are shared across Crocodyliformes,
    perhaps through factors such as the allometric scaling of feeding rate versus basal metabolism with body size. These findings
    suggest that broad-scale patterns of body size evolution and the shapes of body size distributions within higher taxa are often
    determined more by physiological constraints than by ecological interactions or environmental fluctuations.},

  abstract={The latitudinal gradient of increasing marine biodiversity from the poles to the tropics is one of the most conspicuous biological
    patterns in modern oceans. Low-latitude regions of the global ocean are often hotspots of animal biodiversity, yet they are set to be most
    critically affected by anthropogenic climate change. As ocean temperatures rise and deoxygenation proceeds in the coming centuries, the volume
    of aerobically viable habitat is predicted to decrease in these zones. In contrast to the slightly asymmetrical modern latitudinal
    biodiversity gradient, compilations of fossil occurrences indicate peaks in biodiversity may have existed much further away from the equator
    in the past, with transitions between climate states hypothesized to explain this trend. We combine a new compilation of fossil mollusc
    occurrences, paleotemperature proxies, and biogeographic data to reveal a non-monotonic relationship between temperature and diversity
    in the paleontological record over the last 145 million years. We derive a metabolic model that integrates the kinetic effects of temperature
    on biodiversity with the recently described ‘Metabolic Index’ that calculates aerobic habitat availability based on the effect of temperature
    on hypoxia sensitivity. While factors such as coastal habitat area and homeothermy are important, we find strong congruence between
    our metabolic model and our fossil and paleotemperature meta-analysis. We therefore suggest that the effects of ocean temperature on the
    aerobic scope of marine ectotherms is a primary driver of migrating biodiversity peaks through geologic time and will likely play a role
    in the restructuring of biodiversity under projected future climate scenarios.},

  abstract={Convergent evolution is often attributed to adaptation of form to function, but it can also result
    from ecological filtering, exaptation, or nonaptation. Testing among these possibilities is critical
    to understanding how and why morphological similarities emerge independently in multiple
    lineages. To address this challenge, we combined multiple preexisting phylogenetic methods to
    jointly estimate the habitats and morphologies of lineages within a phylogeny. We applied this
    approach to the invasions of snakes into the marine realm. We utilized a dataset for 1,243 extant
    snake species consisting of newly compiled biome occupancy information and preexisting data
    on reproductive strategy, body mass, and environmental temperature and elevation. We find
    evidence for marine clades arising from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Furthermore,
    there is strong evidence of ecological filtering for non-marine ancestors that were already
    viviparous, had slightly larger-than-average body sizes, and that lived in environments with
    higher-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average elevations. In aggregate, similarities
    among independent lineages of marine snakes result from a combination of exaptation and strong
    ecological filtering. Strong barriers to entry of new habitats appear to be more important than
    common adaptations following invasions for producing similarities among independent lineages
    invading a shared, novel habitat.}

    in the idea that the ability to understand and to anticipate the future relies upon our collective
    knowledge of the past. Despite this understanding, the fundamental role that the history of paleontology
    and the geosciences plays in shaping the structure and culture of our disciplines is seldom recognized and
    therefore not acted upon sufficiently. Here, we present a brief review of the history of paleontology and
    geology in Western countries, with a particular focus on North America since the 1800s. Western paleontology
    and geology are intertwined with systematic practices of exclusion, oppression, and erasure that arose from
    their direct participation in the extraction of geological and biological resources at the expense of Black,
    Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Our collective failure to acknowledge this history hinders our
    ability to address these issues meaningfully and systemically in present-day educational, academic, and
    professional settings. By discussing these issues and suggesting some ways forward, we intend to promote a
    deeper reflection upon our collective history and a broader conversation surrounding racism, colonialism,
    and exclusion within our scientific communities. Ultimately, it is necessary to listen to members of the
    communities most impacted by these issues to create actionable steps forward while holding ourselves

    structure is well documented in extant terrestrial mammals, whether this pattern manifests across diverse
    vertebrate clades and biomes is unknown. Moreover, emergence of the U-shape over geological time and future
    persistence are unknown. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of diet and body size spanning several
    vertebrate classes and show that the U-shaped pattern is taxonomically and biogeographically universal
    in modern vertebrate groups, except for marine mammals and seabirds. We further found that, for terrestrial
    mammals, this U-shape emerged by the Palaeocene and has thus persisted for at least 66 million years.
    Yet disruption of this fundamental trophic-size structure in mammals appears likely in the next century,

    spanning the entire evolutionary history of Pseudosuchia. They quantified patterns of average body size, body size
    disparity through time and rates of evolution along phylogenetic lineages. Their results suggest that pseudosuchians
    exhibited considerable variation in rates of body size evolution, for which they provided various group-specific
    explanations and asserted the importance of climatic drivers. This differs from two recent studies that analysed
    a substantial portion of pseudosuchian body size evolution and proposed that adaptation to aquatic life, a biological
    innovation of some subgroups, was the main driver of body size evolution, with patterns of disparity also being
    influenced by size-dependent extinction risk. Here we show that the analytical results of Stockdale & Benton4 are
    strongly influenced by a methodological error in their body size index. Specifically, that they chose not to

    a community-driven R package to aid data preparation and exploration for quantitative palaeobiological research.
    The package is freely available and has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and analyses;
    (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. To develop these aims, we assessed
    the analytical needs of the broader palaeobiological community using an online survey, in addition to
    incorporating our own experiences. In this work, we first report the findings of the survey, which shaped the
    development of the package. Subsequently, we describe and demonstrate the functionality available in palaeoverse
    and provide usage examples. Finally, we discuss the resources we have made available for the community and our
    future plans for the broader Palaeoverse project. palaeoverse is a community-driven R package for palaeobiology,
    developed with the intention of bringing palaeobiologists together to establish agreed standards for high-quality
    quantitative research. The package provides a user-friendly platform for preparing data for analysis with
