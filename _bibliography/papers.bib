  abstract={In birds and feathered non-avian dinosaurs, within-feather pigmentation
  patterns range from discrete spots and stripes to more subtle patterns, but the
  latter remain largely unstudied. A ~55 million year old fossil contour feather with
  a dark distal tip grading into a lighter base was recovered from the Fur Formation
  in Denmark. SEM and synchrotron-based trace metal mapping confirmed that this
  gradient was caused by differential concentration of melanin. To assess the
  potential ecological and phylogenetic prevalence of this pattern, we evaluated 321
  modern samples from 18 orders within Aves. We observed that the pattern was found
  most frequently in distantly related groups that share aquatic ecologies (e.g.
  waterfowl Anseriformes, penguins Sphenisciformes), suggesting a potential adaptive
  function with ancient origins.}

  abstract={The inner ear anatomy of cetaceans, now more readily accessible by means
  of nondestructive high‐resolution X‐ray computed tomographic (CT) scanning, provides
  a window into their acoustic abilities and ecological preferences. Inner ear labyrinths
  also may be a source for additional morphological characters for phylogenetic analyses.
  In this study, we explore digital endocasts of the inner ear labyrinths of representative
  species of extinct and extant porpoises (Mammalia: Cetacea: Phocoenidae), a clade of some
  of the smallest odontocete cetaceans, which produce some of the highest‐frequency clicks
  for biosonar and communication. Metrics used to infer hearing ranges based on cochlear
  morphology indicate that all taxa considered could hear high‐frequency sounds, thus the
  group had already acquired high‐frequency hearing capabilities by the Miocene (9–11 Mya)
  at the latest. Vestibular morphology indicates that extant species with pelagic
  preferences have similarly low semicircular canal deviations from 90°, values indicating
  more sensitivity to head rotations. Species with near‐shore preferences have higher canal
  deviation values, indicating less sensitivity to head rotations. Extending these analyses
  to the extinct species, we demonstrate a good match between those predicted to have
  coastal (such as Semirostrum cerutti) preferences and high canal deviation values. We
  establish new body length relationships based on correlations with inner ear labyrinth
  volume, which can be further explored among other aquatic mammals to infer body size
  of specimens consisting of fragmentary material.}

  abstract={Four extant lineages of mammals have invaded and diversified in the water: Sirenia, Cetacea, Pinnipedia, and Lutrinae.
    Most of these aquatic clades are larger bodied, on average, than their closest land-dwelling relatives, but the extent to which potential
    ecological, biomechanical, and physiological controls contributed to this pattern remains untested quantitatively. Here, we use previously
    published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in
    aquatic mammals through both comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record. Both methods indicate that the
    evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The
    existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most
    hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with
    control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms.
    Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum
    size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather
    than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic
    demands of the aquatic medium.},

  abstract={At least 26 species of crocodylian populate the globe today, but this richness represents a minute fraction of the diversity and
    disparity of Crocodyliformes. Fossil forms are far more varied, spanning from erect, fully terrestrial species to flippered, fully
    marine species. To quantify the influence of a marine habitat on the directionality, rate, and variance of evolution of body size
    in Crocodyliformes and thereby identify underlying selective pressures, we compiled a database of body sizes for 264 fossil and
    modern species of crocodyliform covering terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and marine habitats.We find increases in body size coupled with
    increases in strength of selection and decreases in variance following invasions of marine habitats but not of semiaquatic habitats.
    A model combining constraints from thermoregulation and lung capacity provides a physiological explanation for the larger
    minimum and average sizes of marine species. It appears that constraints on maximum size are shared across Crocodyliformes,
    perhaps through factors such as the allometric scaling of feeding rate versus basal metabolism with body size. These findings
    suggest that broad-scale patterns of body size evolution and the shapes of body size distributions within higher taxa are often
    determined more by physiological constraints than by ecological interactions or environmental fluctuations.},

  abstract={The latitudinal gradient of increasing marine biodiversity from the poles to the tropics is one of the most conspicuous biological
    patterns in modern oceans. Low-latitude regions of the global ocean are often hotspots of animal biodiversity, yet they are set to be most
    critically affected by anthropogenic climate change. As ocean temperatures rise and deoxygenation proceeds in the coming centuries, the volume
    of aerobically viable habitat is predicted to decrease in these zones. In contrast to the slightly asymmetrical modern latitudinal
    biodiversity gradient, compilations of fossil occurrences indicate peaks in biodiversity may have existed much further away from the equator
    in the past, with transitions between climate states hypothesized to explain this trend. We combine a new compilation of fossil mollusc
    occurrences, paleotemperature proxies, and biogeographic data to reveal a non-monotonic relationship between temperature and diversity
    in the paleontological record over the last 145 million years. We derive a metabolic model that integrates the kinetic effects of temperature
    on biodiversity with the recently described ‘Metabolic Index’ that calculates aerobic habitat availability based on the effect of temperature
    on hypoxia sensitivity. While factors such as coastal habitat area and homeothermy are important, we find strong congruence between
    our metabolic model and our fossil and paleotemperature meta-analysis. We therefore suggest that the effects of ocean temperature on the
    aerobic scope of marine ectotherms is a primary driver of migrating biodiversity peaks through geologic time and will likely play a role
    in the restructuring of biodiversity under projected future climate scenarios.},
