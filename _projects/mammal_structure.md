Mammals, which have been evolving and interacting with one another for over 100 million years, have developed quite intricate ecosystems that involve complex trophic interactions and produce iconic trait distributions. However, over the last 300,000 years humans have impacted these networks in profound ways, breaking connections and strengthening others (e.g. habitat fragmentation), introducing new connections and nodes (e.g. invasive species), and even eliminating nodes entirely (e.g. extinction). The goal of this research project is to understand how these mammal communities are structured, and how their ecological networks have been impacted by such human disturbances.
