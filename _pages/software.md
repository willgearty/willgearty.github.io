<p style="overflow: hidden;">
An R package that extends the functionality of other plotting packages like
<b>ggplot2</b> and <b>lattice</b> to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time
intervals, including, but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological
data. The primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also included to assist
with other areas of deep time visualization.

<p style="overflow: hidden;">
An R package developed by palaeobiologists, for palaeobiologists. The aim of palaeoverse
is to generate a community-driven software package of generic functions for the palaeobiology community.
The package does not provide implementations of statistical analyses, rather it provides auxiliary functions
to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility.

<h3>Other software</h3>
<h4><a href="https://williamgearty.com/paleopal/" target="_blank">paleopal</a></h4>
<p>
A proof-of-concept shiny app that helps paleontologists develop data science workflows with a point-and-click interface and translates the workflow into R code on-the-fly. The webapp is built using the <a href="https://github.com/willgearty/shinypal" target="_blank">shinypal framework</a> and hosted as a <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/" target="_blank">webr package</a> with GitHub pages using the <a href="https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/" target="_blank">shinylive package</a>. The source code for paleopal is available on <a href="https://github.com/willgearty/paleopal" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Note that the webapp may take a few seconds to load the first time.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/willgearty/Schizomida" target="_blank">Schizomida Shiny App</a></h4>
<p>
A shiny app that hosts a database for Schizomida, an order of arachnids known as short-tailed whip-scorpions. Shiny apps are usually hosted on servers (e.g., shinyapps.io) or are shared as packages and run locally with R, but this shiny app is hosted via GitHub pages <a href="https://williamgearty.com/Schizomida/" target="_blank">here</a> using the latest <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/" target="_blank">webr</a> infrastructure. This means there are absolutely no server fees and the webapp can be run anywhere a user can access the internet and on any device with a web browser. Aside from taking a few seconds to load, I think it works brilliantly!
