<p>
An R package that extends the functionality of other plotting packages like
`ggplot2` and `lattice` to help facilitate the plotting of data over long time
intervals, including, but not limited to, geological, evolutionary, and ecological
data. The primary goal of 'deeptime' is to enable users to add highly customizable
timescales to their visualizations. Other functions are also included to assist
with other areas of deep time visualization.

<p>
An R package developed by palaeobiologists, for palaeobiologists. The aim of palaeoverse
is to generate a community-driven software package of generic functions for the palaeobiology community.
The package does not provide implementations of statistical analyses, rather it provides auxiliary functions
to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility.
