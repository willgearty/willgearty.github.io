I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, where I study
the factors that governed the diversification of marine reptiles during the Mesozoic Era.
More broadly, I am interested in the biotic and abiotic contraints and drivers of taxonomic and
functional diversity as our planet has changed through time. I integrate
paleontological and neontological tools to investigate the evolution of various biological
systems through time and test hypotheses regarding the constraints and drivers of that evolution.

Right now, I'm interested in:
    <ul>
        <li>The functional morphology and diversification of <a href="/research/marine_invasions/">secondarily marine tetrapods</a></li>
        <li>How humans have impacted the <a href="/research/mammal_structure/">community dynamics of mammals</a></li>
        <li>The role of <a href="/research/energetics/">energetics</a> in diversity dynamics across space and time</li>
        <li><a href="/software/">Developing tools</a> for standardizing evolutionary and paleontological research</li>
        <li><a href="/teaching/">Teaching others</a> about extinctions, R, and phylogenetic comparative methods</li>
    </ul>
