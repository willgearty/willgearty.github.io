I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://researchcomputing.syr.edu/ospo/">Open-Source Program Office</a>
at Syracuse University, where I promote, teach, and practice open science and open-source software development practices.
I develop open-source R packages revolving around data acquisition, cleaning, and visualization. Outside of this I also
conduct research in computational paleobiology. I'm specifically interested in the biotic and abiotic contraints and
drivers of taxonomic and functional diversity across space and time. To accomplish this, I integrate paleontological
and neontological data with advanced computational and statistical tools to investigate the evolution of various
biological systems and test hypotheses regarding the constraints and drivers of that evolution.

Right now, I'm interested in:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/software/">Developing tools</a> for standardizing evolutionary and paleontological research</li>
        <li><a href="/teaching/">Teaching others</a> about extinctions, R, and phylogenetic comparative methods</li>
        <li>The functional morphology and diversification of <a href="/research/marine_invasions/">secondarily marine tetrapods</a></li>
        <li>How humans have impacted the <a href="/research/mammal_structure/">community dynamics of mammals</a></li>
        <li>The role of <a href="/research/energetics/">energetics</a> in diversity dynamics across space and time</li>
    </ul>
